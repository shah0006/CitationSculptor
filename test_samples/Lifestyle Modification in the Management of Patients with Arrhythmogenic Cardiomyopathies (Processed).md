  ACM: Lifestyle Modification Management
---
# Lifestyle Modification in the Management of Patients with Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies (Processed)
## I. Introduction
- **Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) Overview:**
	- ACM is a group of inherited heart muscle diseases.
	- Key characteristics include:
	- High burden of ventricular arrhythmias.
	- Progressive myocardial dysfunction.
	- Elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly in young individuals and athletes.
- **Traditional Clinical Management of ACM:**
	- Historically focused on:
	- Pharmacological interventions to suppress arrhythmias.
	- Implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for SCD prevention.
	- Catheter ablation procedures to reduce arrhythmia burden.
- **Growing Evidence of Lifestyle Influence on ACM:**
	- Environmental factors and individual lifestyle choices have a substantial influence on the clinical course of ACM.
	- Specific factors include:
	- Physical activity levels.
	- Dietary habits.
	- Substance use.
	- Body weight.
	- Psychosocial stress.
	- **Physical Activity:** Intensity, duration, and type of exercise impact ACM. High-intensity/endurance exercise may increase disease risk in genetically predisposed individuals, causing structural remodeling and arrhythmias. Tailored exercise recommendations are crucial.
	- **Physical activity, including intensity, duration, and type, significantly impacts Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM).**
	- **High-intensity and endurance exercises may elevate disease risk in individuals with a genetic predisposition to ACM.**
	- **This increased risk is associated with:**
	- **Structural remodeling of the heart.**
	- **An increased occurrence of arrhythmias.**
	- **Therefore, providing tailored exercise recommendations is critical for managing ACM in these individuals.**
	- **Dietary Patterns:** General cardiovascular health principles (balanced nutrients, limited processed/saturated fats, hydration) are likely relevant. Specific dietary recommendations for ACM require further research.
	- **Substance Consumption:** Chronic alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking may worsen myocardial damage and arrhythmic risk. Illicit cardiotoxic substances pose a significant threat. Substance use assessment and counseling are essential.
	- **Body Mass Index and Metabolic Health:** Obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia can contribute to inflammation and cardiovascular stress, potentially influencing ACM progression. Maintaining a healthy weight and managing metabolic risks are important.
	- **Psychosocial Stress:** Chronic stress may contribute to myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis. Stress management strategies (relaxation, mindfulness, social support) may benefit ACM's clinical course.
Understanding the interplay of these lifestyle factors is crucial for optimizing ACM patient care, and further research is needed for evidence-based lifestyle interventions.
- These factors have been shown to:
	- Modulate disease penetrance.
	- Accelerate disease progression.
	- Impact overall outcomes.
- **Recognition of Lifestyle Modifications as Fundamental:**
	- Lifestyle modifications are increasingly recognized as fundamental, not just adjunctive, components of ACM management.
	- This recognition signifies a potential paradigm shift in managing an inherited condition.
	- Shift from reactive treatments (like ICDs) to a proactive approach influencing the disease trajectory itself.
- **Report Aim:**
	- Provide an in-depth, evidence-based discussion on the role of specific lifestyle modifications in ACM management.
	- Explore the impact of:
	- Physical activity restrictions.
	- Dietary and nutritional factors.
	- Avoidance of detrimental substances.
	- Weight control.
	- Management of psychosocial stressors.
	- Synthesize current research findings.
	- Reference established clinical guidelines from major cardiology organizations.

## II. Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy: Definition, Pathogenesis, and Clinical Spectrum
### A. Nosology and Classification
The terminology used to describe arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies has evolved significantly over the past four decades, reflecting advancements in understanding the disease's underlying nature. Early descriptions, based on pathological findings primarily in the right ventricle (RV), led to the term 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia' (ARVD), suggesting a congenital developmental defect.[^PatelV-2020-32927679] Subsequent research revealed that the disease is progressive, often genetically determined, and not present at birth, leading to its reclassification as a cardiomyopathy and the adoption of the term 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy' (ARVC).[^PatelV-2020-32927679] Both ARVD and ARVC are still sometimes used interchangeably.[^PatelV-2020-32927679]

With increasing recognition through advanced imaging and genetic testing that the disease process is not confined to the RV but can also involve the left ventricle (LV) predominantly (Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy, ALVC) or both ventricles (Biventricular ACM), the broader umbrella term 'Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy' (ACM) gained favor.[^PatelV-2020-32927679] However, the heterogeneity encompassed by "ACM" has led to recent debate, with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines suggesting a potential return to more phenotype-specific terminology, re-emphasizing ARVC for fibro-fatty RV disease and grouping LV forms under non-dilated or dilated cardiomyopathy classifications.[^MazzantiA-2025-39980788] This ongoing evolution in nomenclature reflects the complexity inherent in classifying these conditions, characterized by variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, making diagnosis challenging.[^PatelV-2020-32927679]

The estimated prevalence of ACM ranges from 1:1000 to 1:5000, though this is likely an underestimate as it often excludes biventricular or LV-dominant variants and cases where SCD is the first clinical manifestation.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164]

### B. Pathological Hallmarks
The defining pathological feature of ACM is the progressive replacement of ventricular cardiomyocytes by fibrous and/or fatty tissue.[^PatelV-2020-32927679] This process typically originates in the subepicardium and progresses transmurally.[^ZatharZ-2024-39076315] In classic ARVC, lesions predominantly involve the RV free wall, particularly the "triangle of dysplasia" (inflow tract, outflow tract, apex).[^MalikN-2022-35147040] While fatty infiltration is characteristic, studies suggest fibrous replacement is the more consistent and diagnostically relevant finding.[^GandjbakhchE-2018-30092956]

Beyond passive tissue replacement, ACM involves active biological processes. Inflammatory cell infiltrates are frequently observed in endomyocardial biopsies and autopsy specimens.[^AiwuyoH-2022-36381856] Some patients experience episodes mimicking acute myocarditis, termed the "hot phase," characterized by chest pain, ECG changes, and troponin release, often associated with specific gene mutations like Desmoplakin (DSP).[^BarianiR-2022-36139162] This suggests inflammation plays an active role in disease pathogenesis and progression, potentially offering therapeutic targets beyond arrhythmia suppression or structural support.[^GerullB-2021-34478111]

### C. Genetic Underpinnings
ACM is fundamentally an inherited condition, typically transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance and incomplete expressivity.[^PatelV-2020-32927679] This means that while a pathogenic gene variant is necessary, its presence does not guarantee disease development, and the severity can vary widely even within the same family.[^PatelV-2020-32927679]

The most common genetic basis involves mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins, which are crucial components of the intercalated discs responsible for maintaining structural integrity and cell-to-cell adhesion between cardiomyocytes, particularly under mechanical stress.[^vanDVS-2020-32246823] These genes include Plakophilin-2 (PKP2, the most common), Desmoplakin (DSP), Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), Desmocollin-2 (DSC2), and Plakoglobin (JUP).[^ShahSN-2024] Mutations in these genes are identified in approximately 50-60% of clinically diagnosed ACM cases.[^GerullB-2021-34478111]

Mutations in non-desmosomal genes have also been implicated in ACM phenotypes, including Phospholamban (PLN), Transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43), Desmin (DES), Lamin A/C (LMNA), and Filamin C (FLNC).[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] These genes often encode proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure, nuclear envelope integrity, or calcium handling.

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms linking these genetic defects to the ACM phenotype are complex and still under investigation. Key proposed mechanisms include [^PatelV-2020-32927679]:
- **Impaired Cell Adhesion:** Weakened desmosomes lead to myocyte detachment, apoptosis (cell death), and subsequent replacement by fibrofatty tissue, particularly under mechanical stress.[^CorradoD-2017-28912183]
- **Altered Intracellular Signaling:** Desmosomal dysfunction can disrupt signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo/YAP, potentially promoting adipogenesis and fibrosis.[^HoorntjeE-2017-28957532] Reduced junctional plakoglobin may be a key factor.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164]
- **Ion Channel Remodeling:** Defects in intercalated disc proteins can affect the function and localization of ion channels (e.g., Nav1.5 sodium channels) and gap junctions (e.g., Connexin43), altering electrical conduction and promoting arrhythmogenesis.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164]
- **Inflammation:** Myocyte injury and death can trigger inflammatory responses, further contributing to tissue damage and fibrosis.[^GerullB-2021-34478111]
These processes collectively create a myocardial substrate characterized by structural heterogeneity (fibrosis, fat) and altered electrical properties, predisposing to re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias.

### D. Clinical Manifestations and Primary Risks
ACM typically manifests clinically between the ages of 10 and 50 years, with an average age at diagnosis around 30 years.[^GerullB-2021-34478111] However, presentation can occur earlier, particularly in pediatric cases, or later in life.[^TeRA-2021-34926342] The clinical presentation is highly variable.

Common presenting symptoms are often related to arrhythmias and include palpitations (sensation of rapid, fluttering, or skipped beats), syncope (fainting) or presyncope (lightheadedness, dizziness), particularly associated with physical exertion.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] Other symptoms can include atypical chest pain, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and fatigue.[^MalikN-2022-35147040]

The primary risks associated with ACM are:
- **Ventricular Arrhythmias:** This is the clinical hallmark of the disease.[^PatelV-2020-32927679] These range from frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (>500-1000/24h considered significant) [^ErmakovS-2015-26835106] to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] VT typically originates from the RV (in RV-dominant forms) and exhibits a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology on ECG.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also reported in a subset of patients, often at older ages.[^ESC-ND]
- **Heart Failure (HF):** As the disease progresses with increasing fibrofatty replacement and ventricular dilation/dysfunction, patients may develop symptoms and signs of right-sided, left-sided, or biventricular heart failure.[^vanDVS-2020-32246823] Symptoms include peripheral edema (swelling), ascites, dyspnea on exertion or rest, and fatigue.[^Johns-Arrhyt-2023-ref20] While historically considered a later complication, HF is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, partly due to improved survival from SCD with ICD therapy.[^ChenS-2021-34682905]
- **Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD):** This is the most feared complication, resulting from malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF).[^PatelV-2020-32927679] ACM is a leading cause of SCD in individuals under 35 years old, especially athletes.[^CorradoD-2017-28912183] SCD can occur even in the early, concealed phase of the disease before significant structural changes are apparent, and may tragically be the first sign of the condition.[^vanDVS-2020-32246823]
## III. Physical Activity and Exercise Management in ACM
Physical activity is a critical consideration in the management of ACM due to compelling evidence demonstrating its role as a significant modulator of disease expression, progression, and arrhythmic risk.

### A. Exercise as a Modulator of Disease Expression and Progression
The detrimental effect of exercise in ACM is thought to stem primarily from increased mechanical stress imposed on the ventricular myocardium during physical exertion.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] In individuals with underlying genetic defects affecting desmosomal proteins, this heightened wall stress is hypothesized to exacerbate the dysfunction of cell-to-cell junctions. This can lead to detachment of cardiomyocytes, triggering inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and subsequent replacement of functional heart muscle with non-contractile fibrous and fatty tissue.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] The right ventricle, with its thinner wall compared to the left ventricle, may be particularly susceptible to these load-induced changes.[^RichterT-2015-26409619]

This hypothesis is supported by preclinical and clinical evidence. Animal models, particularly mice carrying mutations in desmosomal genes like *Pkp2*, *Dsp*, or *Dsg2*, consistently demonstrate that endurance exercise protocols induce or accelerate the development of ventricular dilation, dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias, mimicking features of human ACM.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] Human observational studies corroborate these findings. Patients with ACM who have a history of participation in competitive or high-intensity endurance sports tend to exhibit earlier onset of symptoms, increased disease penetrance (manifestation of the phenotype in gene carriers), more severe structural abnormalities (worse RV and LV function, greater extent of fibrofatty replacement), and a higher incidence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and need for heart transplantation compared to less active or sedentary ACM patients.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] This effect appears to extend even to individuals who carry an ACM-associated gene mutation but do not yet show clinical signs of the disease (genotype-positive/phenotype-negative), where intense exercise is linked to earlier and more frequent development of the overt phenotype.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] In some cases, excessive endurance exercise has been proposed as a potential cause of an ARVC-like phenotype even without an identifiable genetic predisposition, termed "exercise-induced AC".[^EberlyL-2021-35082480]

### B. Risks of Competitive and High-Intensity Endurance Exercise
Given the role of exercise in disease progression, it is unsurprising that it also acts as a potent trigger for the primary clinical manifestation: ventricular arrhythmias. Physical exertion, particularly intense or endurance-type activity, is a well-established trigger for PVCs, VT, VF, and consequently SCD in patients with ACM.[^CorradoD-2017-28912183] Tragically, SCD during sport can be the first manifestation of the underlying disease in previously asymptomatic individuals.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] Studies have shown that competitive sports participation increases the risk of SCD several-fold in young individuals with ARVC.[^CorradoD-2015-25971286]

Reflecting the dual role of intense exercise in both triggering acute arrhythmic events and accelerating chronic disease progression, there is a strong international consensus among major cardiology organizations (including the American Heart Association \[AHA\], American College of Cardiology \[ACC\], European Society of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society) regarding restrictions. Guidelines consistently recommend that individuals with a definite, borderline, or possible diagnosis of ACM (including ARVC) should *not* participate in competitive sports, with the potential exception of very low-intensity, skill-based sports (e.g., billiards, bowling, golf).[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] These restrictions are also frequently extended, often as a Class IIa recommendation (reasonable to consider), to genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals to prevent or delay disease onset.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] Furthermore, guidelines explicitly state that an ICD should not be implanted solely for the purpose of enabling continued participation in high-risk sports.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139]

### C. Evidence on Exercise Intensity vs. Duration
Research has sought to disentangle the relative contributions of exercise intensity and duration to the observed risks. Several studies suggest that exercise *intensity* is the more critical determinant of adverse outcomes in ACM.[^SemsarianC-2022-36075839] High-intensity exercise, often defined using Metabolic Equivalents (METs) as activity requiring ≥6 METs (e.g., running, competitive sports), has been shown to be a strong and independent predictor of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF, aborted cardiac arrest, appropriate ICD therapy), even when performed for relatively short durations.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] Conversely, studies indicate that longer durations of *low-intensity* exercise (e.g., <6 METs) do not appear to confer the same level of risk and may not significantly alter the natural disease progression compared to inactivity.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139]

A dose-dependent relationship between the overall exercise dose – typically quantified as intensity multiplied by duration (e.g., MET-hours per week or per year) – and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and disease progression/penetrance has been observed.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] Some analyses suggest a non-linear relationship, with risk potentially increasing more steeply above a certain threshold. One study proposed a threshold around 15-30 MET-hours/week, above which the risk of incident sustained VA significantly increased, supporting ESC recommendations to limit activity below this level.[^BosmanL-2022-35089054] Another source suggested a limit below 650 MET-hours per year.[^ShahSN-2024]

Importantly, studies have demonstrated that reducing exercise duration and/or dose after an ACM diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in subsequent arrhythmic events.[^WangW-2018-29909402] Greater reductions in exercise dose appear to confer greater reductions in arrhythmia risk.[^WangW-2018-29909402] However, it is crucial to note that even substantial exercise reduction in high-risk individuals (e.g., those with prior arrhythmias or significant structural disease) may not eliminate the risk entirely and is unlikely to be sufficient grounds for deferring ICD implantation when otherwise indicated.[^WangW-2018-29909402]

### D. Guideline-Based Restrictions and Recommendations for Safe Recreational Activity
Synthesizing the evidence, current guidelines provide a framework for advising ACM patients on physical activity. The cornerstone principle is the avoidance of competitive sports and high-intensity (≥6 METs) or endurance-type exercise.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480]

However, recognizing the detrimental health effects of complete inactivity and the potential benefits of physical activity for overall well-being and quality of life, guidelines generally permit and may even encourage low-to-moderate intensity recreational activity, particularly for individuals assessed to be at lower arrhythmic risk.[^ShahSN-2024]

Specific recommendations vary slightly but generally converge:
- **ESC 2020 Sports Cardiology Guidelines:** Recommend low-intensity exercise (aiming for 150 min/week, keeping maximum heart rate <55% of age-predicted maximum) for all ACM patients and gene carriers. Moderate-intensity exercise may be considered *only* in low-risk patients after careful evaluation. High-intensity exercise is not advised.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139]
- **HRS 2019 ACM Consensus Statement:** Advises against frequent high-intensity endurance exercise in ACM patients and gene carriers, favoring low-intensity activities.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139]
- **AHA/ACC:** While primarily focused on competitive sports eligibility (which is restricted), acknowledges the lack of harm demonstrated with low-to-moderate intensity recreational activity.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139]
- **MET-based thresholds:** Some sources suggest limiting activity below 15 MET-hours/week [^BosmanL-2022-35089054] or 650 MET-hours/year (roughly equivalent to 30 minutes of brisk walking daily).[^ShahSN-2024]
Examples of generally permissible lower-intensity activities include brisk walking, light jogging on flat terrain, recreational cycling on flat terrain, swimming in supervised settings, golf, bowling, doubles tennis, yoga, light stretching, and low-impact aerobics.[^KaddouraR-2022-36605925] Activities involving sudden bursts of exertion (e.g., sprinting) or heavy static effort (e.g., heavy weightlifting) should generally be avoided.[^WangW-2026-41484731]

Crucially, exercise prescriptions must be highly individualized.[^ESC-articl-2024-ref59] This requires a comprehensive baseline assessment of disease severity, arrhythmic risk factors (including history of syncope, documented arrhythmias like >500 PVCs/24h or NSVT, extent of RV/LV dysfunction or fibrosis/LGE, specific high-risk genotypes like TMEM43 or Lamin A/C), and the patient's individual goals and preferences.[^MartiniM-2025-39980766] Exercise stress testing can be a valuable tool in this risk stratification process.[^Martínez-SoléJ-2021-34733888] Shared decision-making between the patient and an expert multidisciplinary team is paramount.[^ZorziA-2021-33961139] Regular clinical follow-up, including reassessment of symptoms, ECG, and imaging, is mandatory, especially for gene carriers or those engaging in permitted levels of activity.[^ACC-Page-2016-ref31]

The consistent and strong evidence linking intense exercise to adverse outcomes in ACM solidifies exercise restriction as a cornerstone therapeutic intervention, distinguishing it from general lifestyle advice. This applies even to asymptomatic individuals carrying pathogenic mutations, highlighting its role in primary prevention of disease manifestation.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] However, the recommendation is not for complete sedentarism, which carries its own health risks and negatively impacts quality of life.[^WangW-2026-41484731] The clinical challenge, therefore, lies in carefully navigating the balance between necessary restriction of high-risk activities and the permission of safe, lower-intensity recreational exercise. The current understanding points to exercise *intensity* as the primary driver of risk, making intensity limitation the key focus of exercise prescriptions for ACM patients.[^SemsarianC-2022-36075839]

## IV. The Role of Diet and Nutrition
While exercise modification is a well-established component of ACM management, the role of diet and nutrition is less defined by specific evidence within this patient population. Current recommendations often rely on extrapolation from general cardiovascular health principles and guidelines for managing common comorbidities like heart failure (HF) and hypertension.[^ZatharZ-2024-39076315]

### A. Applicability of General Heart-Healthy Dietary Patterns
There is a scarcity of clinical trials directly investigating the impact of specific dietary patterns on outcomes in human ACM populations. Consequently, management strategies often incorporate general heart-healthy dietary advice. Diets such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) pattern and the Mediterranean diet, which emphasize high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fish, while limiting processed foods, added sugars, sodium, and saturated/trans fats, are widely recommended for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention and for heart failure management by major organizations like the AHA and ESC.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] Adherence to these patterns promotes overall cardiovascular health by improving blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control, and reducing inflammation.

### B. Sodium Intake Considerations
Sodium restriction is a cornerstone of dietary management for patients experiencing symptoms of heart failure, a potential complication of progressive ACM.[^ChenS-2021-34682905] By limiting sodium intake, typically recommended at <2-3 grams per day in general HF guidelines, fluid retention can be reduced, alleviating symptoms of congestion (e.g., edema, dyspnea) and decreasing cardiac preload.[^EH-2025] Stricter limits (e.g., <1.5-2 g/day) may be considered for patients with severe HF symptoms or hyponatremia.[^WickmanB-2021-34959976] Practical strategies include avoiding processed and canned foods, limiting restaurant meals, reading food labels carefully for sodium content (including hidden sources like sodium benzoate or citrate), and using herbs, spices, citrus, or vinegar for flavoring instead of table salt.[^EH-2025]

However, the optimal level of sodium restriction is debated, and some studies suggest potential downsides to very low sodium intake (<1.5 g/day), such as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or potential adverse effects on nutritional status if food palatability is severely reduced.[^WickmanB-2021-34959976] Furthermore, some population studies have hinted at a U-shaped or J-shaped association between sodium intake and atrial fibrillation risk, suggesting potential harm at both very low and very high intake levels.[^WuopioJ-2021-33210391] Given the lack of ACM-specific data, a pragmatic approach involves tailoring sodium restriction based on the individual patient's HF status and symptoms, generally aligning with the moderate restrictions (2-3 g/day) recommended in HF guidelines for most patients, reserving stricter limits for those with clear clinical indications like volume overload.[^WickmanB-2021-34959976]

### C. Dietary Fats: Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Other Considerations
Dietary fats play a complex role in cardiovascular health. While saturated and trans fats should be minimized according to general heart-healthy guidelines [^EH-2025], unsaturated fats, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are considered beneficial.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] The main omega-3 PUFAs are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), found primarily in fatty fish and seafood, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), found in plant sources like flaxseeds, walnuts, and canola oil.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655]

Omega-3 PUFAs have established benefits in lowering plasma triglyceride levels and may also exert favorable effects on blood pressure, inflammation, and endothelial function.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] Their potential anti-arrhythmic effects have garnered significant interest. Proposed mechanisms include altering cell membrane fluidity and directly modulating cardiac ion channels (e.g., inhibiting L-type calcium and late sodium currents), which could stabilize cardiomyocyte electrical activity.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] Animal studies have shown protective effects against ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation.[^MozaffarianD-2011-22051327] However, clinical trial evidence in humans regarding arrhythmia prevention is mixed.[^MozaffarianD-2011-22051327] While some studies suggested benefits, particularly for SCD prevention (potentially linked to reduced fatal ventricular arrhythmias), others have not shown clear benefits, and some recent large trials have even raised concerns about a possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation, especially with high-dose (e.g., 4g/day) purified EPA supplements.[^Cleveland-Omega3-2017-ref151]

Given the inconsistent data on supplements, current recommendations generally favor obtaining omega-3 PUFAs from dietary sources. The AHA recommends consuming fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, tuna) at least twice per week.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] Incorporating plant sources of ALA (flaxseed, walnuts, canola oil) is also advised.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] For ACM patients, while specific recommendations are absent, ensuring adequate intake of omega-3s through a heart-healthy diet seems prudent, but caution is warranted regarding high-dose supplementation until more definitive evidence on arrhythmia risk in this specific population is available.

### D. Insights from Preclinical Studies (e.g., High-Fat Diet)
While human data are limited, preclinical studies offer some insights. A study using a robust mouse model of ACM (homozygous Desmoglein-2 mutation) investigated the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD).[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] Compared to mutant mice on a standard chow diet, those fed an HFD for 8 weeks exhibited significantly worse cardiac function (reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), adverse cardiac remodeling (LV remodeling), and ECG abnormalities (P-wave perturbations, reduced R-amplitude). Furthermore, the HFD led to substantial elevations in myocardial levels of inflammatory adipokines, specifically adiponectin (AdipoQ) and fibroblast growth factor-1, although it did not appear to worsen cardiac fibrosis in this model.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] An intriguing finding was a positive correlation between plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and LVEF in the HFD-fed mutant mice, suggesting a possible complex or even protective role for HDL in this context.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835]

These findings suggest that an HFD, potentially reflecting diets high in saturated fats common in Western societies [^CentnerA-2024-38999835], can exacerbate key pathological features of ACM, namely cardiac dysfunction and inflammation. The mechanism may involve the known pro-inflammatory effects of HFDs (e.g., via NFκB signaling and oxidative stress), potentiating the underlying inflammatory processes already implicated in ACM pathogenesis.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] While direct extrapolation to humans requires caution, this preclinical evidence provides a biological rationale for advising ACM patients against diets high in unhealthy fats, as they might worsen disease phenotypes beyond their general cardiovascular impact.

### E. Current Evidence and Recommendations
In summary, specific dietary guidelines tailored for ACM patients are currently lacking due to insufficient direct evidence. Management relies on applying principles from general cardiovascular prevention and heart failure treatment. Adhering to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, such as the DASH or Mediterranean diet, is strongly recommended.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] Sodium intake should be managed based on individual heart failure status, typically aiming for <2-3 g/day for symptomatic patients.[^WickmanB-2021-34959976] Incorporating healthy fats, particularly omega-3 fatty acids from fish and plant sources, is advisable, while limiting saturated and trans fats.[^ChaddhaA-2015-26621655] The preclinical data linking high-fat diets to worsened inflammation and cardiac dysfunction in an ACM model further support the avoidance of unhealthy dietary patterns.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] There is a clear need for future research, including clinical trials, specifically designed to evaluate the impact of various dietary interventions on disease progression, arrhythmia burden, and quality of life in patients with ACM.

## V. Impact of Substance Use on ACM
Substance use represents another modifiable lifestyle factor with potentially significant implications for patients with ACM, given their inherent susceptibility to arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction.

### A. Alcohol Consumption and Arrhythmia Risk
Alcohol exerts complex, dose-dependent effects on the cardiovascular system. While some epidemiological studies suggest a 'J-shaped' curve, with light-to-moderate consumption potentially associated with lower cardiovascular risk compared to abstention, heavy or binge drinking is unequivocally associated with adverse outcomes, including hypertension, stroke, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078]

Alcohol possesses significant arrhythmogenic potential, capable of inducing both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia linked to alcohol, with risk increasing even at low-to-moderate intake levels.[^DayE-2019-31309639] The phenomenon known as "Holiday Heart Syndrome" refers to the onset of acute arrhythmias, most often AF but occasionally other supraventricular or even ventricular arrhythmias, following an episode of binge drinking, even in individuals without underlying structural heart disease.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078] This observation underscores alcohol's capacity for acute arrhythmogenicity at high doses. For individuals with ACM, who already possess an arrhythmogenic substrate, such binge episodes likely carry a substantially amplified risk of triggering dangerous arrhythmias, including potentially fatal VT/VF.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078]

Chronic heavy alcohol consumption (often defined as >60-80 grams/day for >5 years) can lead to alcoholic cardiomyopathy (A-DCM), a form of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular dilation, impaired contractility, and a high risk of both AF and ventricular arrhythmias.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078] Heavy drinking is also associated with an increased risk of SCD, likely mediated by fatal arrhythmias.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078]

Potential mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced arrhythmias include direct myocardial toxicity, alterations in autonomic tone (sympathetic activation, impaired vagal control), electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia), prolongation of the QT interval, and exacerbation of underlying cardiac conditions or sleep apnea.[^DayE-2019-31309639]

Given the inherent electrical instability in ACM, prudence dictates that alcohol consumption should be strictly limited or ideally avoided altogether. While specific guidelines for ACM are scarce, general patient advice often includes reducing alcohol intake.[^CS-ND] General population guidelines recommend moderation (e.g., limiting intake if choosing to drink) [^LichtensteinA-2021-34724806], but for ACM patients, the threshold for harm is likely much lower, and complete abstinence may be the safest approach, particularly considering the risks associated with binge drinking.

### B. Caffeine Intake: Evaluating the Evidence
Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant globally, found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks.[^HamadA-2024-39687718] Historically, patients with arrhythmias or palpitations were often advised to avoid caffeine due to concerns about its potential pro-arrhythmic effects.[^Researchgate-ND] Proposed mechanisms for caffeine-induced arrhythmias, particularly at high doses, include inhibition of phosphodiesterase (leading to increased cyclic AMP), enhanced intracellular calcium release, catecholamine release, and antagonism of adenosine receptors.[^HamadA-2024-39687718]

However, recent large-scale observational studies and meta-analyses have largely challenged the notion that habitual, moderate caffeine consumption increases arrhythmia risk.[^Researchgate-ND] Several studies indicate that consuming up to 3-5 cups of coffee per day is not associated with an increased risk of incident AF, supraventricular tachycardia, or ventricular arrhythmias, and may even be associated with a slightly *reduced* risk.[^KimE-2021-34279564] One very large prospective cohort study (UK Biobank) found that each additional daily cup of coffee was associated with a 3% *lower* risk of incident arrhythmia, and this association was not significantly modified by genetic variants affecting caffeine metabolism.[^KimE-2021-34279564] Significant risk appears confined primarily to very high intake levels (e.g., >9 cups/day in one older study [^MyersM-1991-1984393]) or consumption via highly concentrated sources like energy drinks, which often contain other potentially pro-arrhythmic ingredients.[^VittoriaMMPFFA-2014-27957108]

Specific recommendations for caffeine intake in ACM patients are lacking in major guidelines. General advice often suggests limiting caffeine.[^CS-ND] Based on current evidence, moderate habitual coffee consumption (e.g., 1-3 cups/day) appears unlikely to be harmful for most ACM patients. However, individual sensitivity can vary, and patients should be mindful of caffeine as a potential personal trigger for palpitations. High-caffeine energy drinks should generally be avoided.

### C. Smoking and Cardiovascular Health in ACM
Tobacco smoking is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing significantly to atherosclerosis, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and thrombosis.[^WHO-2025] Smoking cessation is a fundamental recommendation in all cardiovascular prevention guidelines.[^LichtensteinA-2021-34724806]

While smoking does not directly cause the genetic defect underlying ACM, its profound negative impact on overall cardiovascular health makes it highly relevant for ACM patients. Smoking likely exacerbates the overall cardiovascular burden, potentially worsening endothelial function, promoting inflammation, increasing hemodynamic stress, and contributing to the development or progression of comorbidities like coronary artery disease or hypertension, all of which could negatively impact outcomes in individuals with ACM.[^AiwuyoH-2022-36381856] Therefore, complete smoking cessation is strongly recommended for all patients with ACM.[^BHF-2025]

### D. Illicit and Stimulant Drugs
The use of illicit drugs, particularly stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, and methamphetamine, poses an extreme danger to individuals with ACM.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] These substances have potent and detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. They are known to cause acute myocardial infarction (often via coronary vasospasm or accelerated atherosclerosis), hypertension, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, and profound electrical instability.[^MorentinB-2018-RoleToxic]

Stimulant drugs exert their arrhythmogenic effects through multiple pathways [^MorentinB-2018-RoleToxic]:
- **Sympathetic Overdrive:** They markedly increase circulating catecholamine levels by inhibiting reuptake (cocaine) or promoting release (amphetamines), leading to tachycardia, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and heightened arrhythmogenicity.
- **Ion Channel Blockade:** Cocaine, in particular, blocks sodium channels (similar to Class I antiarrhythmics), which can slow conduction and promote re-entry, especially in diseased tissue. It can also affect potassium and calcium channels, potentially prolonging repolarization or causing early afterdepolarizations.
- **Calcium Overload:** Stimulants can increase intracellular calcium concentrations, contributing to triggered activity and arrhythmias.
- **Structural Remodeling:** Chronic use can lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, creating a long-term substrate for arrhythmias and heart failure.
Consequently, stimulant abuse is strongly associated with a wide range of arrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, AF, VT, VF, and even bradyarrhythmias like AV block or sinus bradycardia (particularly with chronic cocaine use due to potential receptor desensitization).[^DominicP-2022-34961335] Illicit drug use, especially cocaine and amphetamines, is a significant contributor to SCD, particularly in young adults.[^MorentinB-2018-RoleToxic] The combination of cocaine and alcohol is particularly dangerous, forming cocaethylene, a metabolite with enhanced cardiotoxicity and a markedly increased risk of SCD.[^MorentinB-2018-RoleToxic]

Given the already heightened risk of life-threatening arrhythmias inherent to ACM, the addition of potent pro-arrhythmic triggers like cocaine or amphetamines creates an exceptionally high-risk scenario. Therefore, absolute avoidance of all illicit and stimulant drugs is an essential and non-negotiable lifestyle recommendation for all patients with ACM.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962]

In managing substance use in ACM, a clear distinction must be made. While moderate, habitual intake of caffeine appears relatively safe based on recent evidence, and low-level alcohol intake might be tolerated by some low-risk individuals (though abstinence is safest), illicit stimulants and tobacco represent unambiguous threats. Stimulants directly provoke arrhythmias and worsen cardiac structure, while smoking imposes a severe general cardiovascular burden. Therefore, clinical counseling should prioritize complete cessation of smoking and absolute avoidance of illicit drugs, while providing individualized guidance on caffeine and alcohol based on risk assessment and patient factors.[^BHF-2025]

## VI. Body Weight, Obesity, and ACM Outcomes
Body weight and adiposity represent another potentially modifiable factor influencing cardiovascular health and outcomes in patients with ACM.

### A. Obesity as an Independent Cardiovascular and Arrhythmia Risk Factor
Obesity, typically defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or higher, is a global health epidemic and a well-established independent risk factor for a multitude of cardiovascular conditions.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] These include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and notably, heart failure (particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF).[^YuristaS-2023-38939495] Beyond these comorbidities, increasing adiposity itself is recognized as an independent pro-arrhythmic risk factor, associated with higher rates of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as SCD.[^PatelK-2022-36936556]

The mechanisms linking obesity to increased arrhythmia susceptibility are multifactorial and include [^PeroneF-2024-39346126]:
- **Structural Remodeling:** Obesity promotes atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), altering cardiac geometry and conduction pathways.
- **Epicardial Adipose Tissue:** Accumulation of fat around the heart (epicardial fat) can directly infiltrate the myocardium and exert pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects.
- **Inflammation:** Obesity is a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, with elevated circulating cytokines that can adversely affect cardiac electrophysiology.
- **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Obesity is often associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and reduced parasympathetic tone, favoring arrhythmogenesis.
- **Hemodynamic Alterations:** Increased blood volume and cardiac output associated with obesity increase cardiac workload and wall stress.
- **Associated Comorbidities:** Coexisting conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which are highly prevalent in obesity, are themselves independent risk factors for arrhythmias.
### B. Potential Mechanisms Linking Obesity to ACM Pathophysiology/Progression
While direct studies investigating the impact of obesity specifically on ACM disease progression in humans are scarce, several plausible mechanisms suggest that excess body weight could negatively influence the course of ACM:
- **Exacerbation of Inflammation:** As noted, ACM pathogenesis involves an inflammatory component.[^GerullB-2021-34478111] Obesity is also characterized by systemic inflammation.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] It is conceivable that the pro-inflammatory state associated with obesity could synergize with the inherent inflammation in ACM, potentially accelerating myocardial damage, fibrosis, and the development of arrhythmogenic substrate. The HFD mouse model provides preclinical support for this, showing increased inflammatory markers in the hearts of obese ACM mice.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835]
- **Increased Hemodynamic Load:** Obesity increases cardiac output and circulating blood volume, thereby increasing the workload and mechanical stress on the heart.[^ElagiziA-2020-33002458] Given that mechanical stress is a key factor implicated in exacerbating desmosomal dysfunction and driving disease progression in ACM (as evidenced by the effects of intense exercise) [^HaugaaK-2016-26498164], the chronic hemodynamic overload associated with obesity could potentially contribute to a similar detrimental effect, accelerating ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.
- **Influence on Fibrofatty Replacement:** ACM is characterized by fibro*fatty* replacement. While speculative, it is possible that systemic metabolic changes associated with obesity and altered lipid metabolism could influence the degree or nature of fatty infiltration within the myocardium, although the HFD mouse study did not show an increase in fibrosis.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835]
Further support for the negative impact of obesity on inherited cardiomyopathies comes from studies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). A large registry study demonstrated that obese patients with HCM had more severe symptoms, a higher likelihood of outflow tract obstruction, and worse long-term outcomes, particularly regarding heart failure progression, compared to normal-weight HCM patients.[^FumagalliC-2020-31693057] While HCM and ACM have distinct underlying genetics and pathophysiology, this finding suggests that the superimposed burden of obesity likely exacerbates various forms of underlying myocardial disease.

### C. Benefits of Weight Management for Cardiovascular Health and Heart Failure
Weight management through lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), pharmacotherapy (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists), or bariatric surgery offers significant benefits for cardiovascular health in individuals with overweight or obesity.[^LichtensteinA-2021-34724806] Intentional weight loss leads to improvements in blood pressure, lipid profiles (especially triglycerides), glycemic control, and inflammatory markers, thereby reducing the risk of incident cardiovascular events, including HF and AF.[^YuristaS-2023-38939495]

In patients with established heart failure, particularly HFpEF where obesity is highly prevalent, weight loss interventions have demonstrated significant benefits. Studies show improvements in exercise capacity (e.g., 6-minute walk distance), quality of life scores (e.g., Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire), HF symptoms, and biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP) following weight loss achieved through lifestyle programs or medications like semaglutide.[^Cleveland-Obesit-2024-ref186] Sustained weight loss has also been associated with reduced AF burden and improved success rates after AF ablation in obese individuals.[^AhammedM-2023-37908920] While the "obesity paradox" (observed better survival in overweight/mildly obese HF patients) exists, it may be confounded by factors like cardiorespiratory fitness, reverse causality (illness causing weight loss), and earlier diagnosis in obese patients; current guidelines still generally recommend weight management for patients with moderate-to-severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m²) or those with obesity and significant HF symptoms.[^YuristaS-2023-38939495]

For patients with ACM who are overweight or obese, weight management should be considered an important component of their care.[^CS-ND] Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can help control associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes, reduce overall cardiovascular risk, and alleviate potential HF symptoms. Furthermore, by potentially reducing systemic inflammation and hemodynamic load, weight management might mitigate factors that could otherwise accelerate ACM progression or increase arrhythmia susceptibility.[^FumagalliC-2020-31693057] Given the increasing recognition of HF as a significant long-term complication in ACM survivors [^ChenS-2021-34682905], addressing obesity becomes particularly relevant.

## VII. Psychosocial Factors in ACM
Living with a diagnosis of ACM carries a significant psychosocial burden, impacting mental health and quality of life (QoL). Furthermore, psychological factors like stress can potentially influence the clinical course of the disease.

### A. The Psychological Impact of ACM Diagnosis and Management
Inherited cardiac conditions (ICCs) like ACM present unique and complex psychosocial challenges.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Patients must cope with the reality of a lifelong condition, the inherent risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias and SCD, necessary lifestyle adjustments (particularly exercise restrictions), and the implications of genetic inheritance for themselves and their family members.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Diagnosis may occur against a backdrop of grief and trauma if precipitated by a sudden death or cardiac arrest in the family.[^AHA-Psycho-2025-ref97] Uncertainty about disease progression and prognosis adds to the burden.[^AatreR-2011-21325164]

Studies consistently show elevated rates of anxiety and depression among individuals with ICCs and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), often exceeding rates seen in patients with acquired heart disease like ischemic cardiomyopathy.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Research specifically in ARVC populations confirms this, revealing clinically significant levels of anxiety (up to 33%) and depression (up to 19%) and overall lower mental and physical QoL compared to normative samples, although QoL may be comparable or slightly better than some other ICD populations.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501]

The implantation of an ICD, while life-saving, introduces its own set of psychological challenges.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Fear and anxiety related to the anticipation or experience of an ICD shock (both appropriate and inappropriate) are common and can significantly impact QoL.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Other concerns include alterations in body image, perceived restrictions on physical or sexual activity, and social anxiety or isolation.[^DayS-2012-22337923] Factors associated with poorer psychosocial adjustment and lower QoL in ARVC/ICD patients include younger age at diagnosis/implantation, female sex, history of receiving ICD shocks, lower functional capacity, and lower educational attainment.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Device acceptance, crucial for adjustment, can be influenced by these factors, with younger patients sometimes reporting more body image concerns and device-related distress.[^DayS-2012-22337923]

### B. Role of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression
Beyond being consequences of the disease and its treatment, psychosocial factors like stress, anxiety, and depression can potentially act as modifiers of cardiovascular health and disease progression. Acute emotional stress, anger, and other negative psychological states are well-known triggers for cardiac arrhythmias, including potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, in various populations.[^Researchgate-2008]

The biological link involves the body's physiological stress response, mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[^AHA-2024] Acute stress triggers the release of catecholamines (like adrenaline), causing transient increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility – the "fight or flight" response.[^AHA-2024] Chronic stress leads to sustained activation of these systems, contributing to elevated blood pressure, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet aggregation, and potentially adverse cardiac remodeling.[^AHA-2024] Increased sympathetic tone, in particular, is known to be pro-arrhythmic.[^Researchgate-2008] Studies measuring metabolic activity in the amygdala (a brain region involved in stress response) have shown a correlation between higher stress levels and increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.[^Shortlister-Stress-2023-ref196]

Direct evidence linking psychosocial stress (PSS) to ACM progression comes from a preclinical study using a resident-intruder paradigm in the Dsg2 mutant mouse model.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451] This study found that ACM mice subjected to PSS experienced significantly higher rates of sudden death during the stress exposure compared to wildtype controls. Survivors exhibited markedly worse cardiac dysfunction, increased apoptosis, and fibrosis compared to non-stressed ACM mice. Interestingly, the stressed ACM mice also displayed heightened anxiety-like behavior following the stress exposure, which correlated with the worsening cardiac phenotypes.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451] Furthermore, patient data collected in the same study showed a correlation between higher perceived stress levels and greater arrhythmia burden and cardiac dysfunction in humans with ACM.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451] These findings strongly suggest that psychosocial stress, similar to physical stress (exercise), can act as an independent factor that accelerates disease progression and increases mortality risk in ACM, potentially representing an underappreciated environmental trigger.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451]

### C. Benefits of Stress Management and Psychological Support
Given the psychological burden of living with ACM and the potential for stress to negatively impact cardiac outcomes, incorporating stress management strategies and psychological support into patient care is crucial. Managing stress is beneficial for general health and well-being and is associated with improved cardiovascular health outcomes.[^AHA-2024]

Effective stress management techniques include:
- **Regular Physical Activity:** Exercise, particularly moderate-intensity aerobic activity, is a well-established method for relieving stress, tension, anxiety, and depression.[^WangW-2026-41484731] For ACM patients, this needs to be carefully tailored to safe, low-to-moderate intensity levels as previously discussed.
- **Relaxation Techniques:** Practices like deep breathing exercises (e.g., 4-7-8 breathing), meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and listening to music can help calm the nervous system, lower blood pressure, and reduce anxiety.[^ESC-articl-2024-ref59]
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT helps individuals identify and modify negative thought patterns and develop adaptive coping strategies. It has proven effective in reducing depression and anxiety in various cardiovascular populations, including ICD recipients.[^DayS-2012-22337923] Developing a "shock plan" can be part of this for ICD patients.[^DayS-2012-22337923]
- **Social Support:** Maintaining strong connections with friends, family, and support groups provides emotional resilience and buffers against stress.[^DayS-2012-22337923] Peer support groups specifically for ICC patients can reduce anxiety and isolation.[^Researchgate-ND]
- **Positive Psychology:** Cultivating positive mental states like optimism, gratitude, and a sense of purpose is associated with better cardiovascular health and longevity.[^AHA-2024] Keeping a gratitude journal is one suggested practice.[^AHA-2024]
- **Adequate Sleep:** Ensuring sufficient sleep (7-9 hours for adults) is vital for managing stress and overall health.[^AHA-ND]
- **Healthy Lifestyle:** Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, and managing weight also contribute to stress resilience.[^AHA-2024]
Integrating psychological assessment and support within the multidisciplinary care team for ACM patients is essential.[^IvanivY-2023-Overview2023] Identifying patients at higher risk for psychological distress (e.g., younger individuals, females, those with shock history) allows for targeted interventions.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Providing education about the condition and treatment (including ICD function), facilitating access to counseling or therapy (like CBT), and connecting patients with peer support resources can significantly improve coping, adjustment, QoL, and potentially mitigate the adverse cardiac effects of chronic stress.[^DayS-2012-22337923] The bidirectional relationship between psychological distress and cardiovascular outcomes underscores the need for this holistic approach; addressing mental well-being is not just about improving QoL but may also be critical for optimizing physical health outcomes in ACM.

## VIII. Synthesis: Integrating Lifestyle Modifications into ACM Management
The comprehensive management of ACM requires a multifaceted approach that extends beyond pharmacological and device-based therapies to encompass crucial lifestyle modifications. Integrating evidence-based lifestyle changes targets various aspects of the disease pathophysiology and aims to reduce arrhythmia burden, potentially slow disease progression, and improve overall quality of life for affected individuals.

- **Exercise Restriction:** This remains the most critical and well-supported lifestyle intervention for ACM.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] By avoiding competitive sports and high-intensity endurance activities (generally ≥6 METs), patients reduce the mechanical stress on the vulnerable myocardium, thereby lessening the stimulus for desmosomal breakdown, myocyte death, fibrofatty replacement, and adverse remodeling.[^HaugaaK-2016-26498164] This restriction directly addresses a key environmental trigger known to accelerate disease progression and provoke life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.[^CorradoD-2017-28912183] Importantly, this recommendation extends to asymptomatic gene carriers.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] While restriction is crucial, carefully prescribed low-to-moderate intensity recreational activity is generally permissible for low-risk individuals to maintain overall fitness and well-being.[^ShahSN-2024]
- **Diet and Nutrition:** Adherence to a heart-healthy dietary pattern (e.g., DASH, Mediterranean) contributes to managing common cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension and dyslipidemia, which can indirectly benefit ACM patients.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] Appropriate sodium restriction is vital for managing fluid balance and symptoms in patients who develop heart failure.[^EH-2025] Avoiding diets high in saturated fats may help mitigate systemic inflammation, a factor potentially contributing to ACM pathogenesis, as suggested by preclinical data.[^CentnerA-2024-38999835] While direct evidence for dietary impact on ACM progression is limited, optimizing nutrition supports overall cardiovascular health and manages factors that could exacerbate the condition.
- **Substance Avoidance:** Eliminating tobacco use removes a major cardiovascular toxin known to promote atherosclerosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.[^BHF-2025] Absolute avoidance of illicit stimulant drugs like cocaine and amphetamines is critical due to their potent direct arrhythmogenic effects and ability to cause severe cardiovascular complications, including SCD.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] Strict limitation or avoidance of alcohol is advisable, given its known pro-arrhythmic potential, especially with binge consumption, which poses a heightened risk in patients with an underlying arrhythmogenic substrate.[^ToneloD-2013-24030078] Moderate caffeine intake appears less concerning based on recent evidence, but individual assessment is warranted.[^Researchgate-ND]
- **Weight Management:** Achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is important for reducing overall cardiovascular risk and managing comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and HF, which are relevant to ACM patients.[^CS-ND] Given the potential links between obesity, inflammation, and hemodynamic load, weight control in overweight/obese ACM patients may help mitigate factors that could worsen disease progression and is crucial for managing HF symptoms if they arise.
- **Psychosocial Well-being and Stress Management:** Addressing the significant psychological burden associated with ACM is vital for improving QoL.[^RhodesA-2017-28823501] Providing psychological support, education, and access to resources like peer support groups can enhance coping and adjustment.[^DayS-2012-22337923] Furthermore, managing chronic stress through techniques like appropriate exercise, relaxation practices, and CBT may help reduce potential arrhythmic triggers associated with sympathetic activation and improve overall cardiovascular health.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451] Preclinical evidence suggests stress itself might accelerate ACM progression, underscoring the importance of stress management.[^AgrimiJ-2020-33255451]
In conclusion, lifestyle modifications are not peripheral considerations but integral components of optimal ACM care. They work synergistically with medical and device therapies to minimize arrhythmia triggers, manage comorbidities, potentially slow the underlying disease process by mitigating factors like mechanical and inflammatory stress, and improve patient well-being and QoL.

## IX. Current Clinical Guidelines and Consensus Statements
Major cardiology organizations, including the AHA, ACC, ESC, and HRS, have issued guidelines and consensus statements that address various aspects of ACM management, including lifestyle recommendations.

- **Exercise Restrictions:** There is strong and consistent guidance across multiple documents recommending against participation in competitive sports and high-intensity (typically ≥6 METs) or endurance exercise for individuals with diagnosed ACM (ARVC).[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] This recommendation is often extended (as Class IIa or similar) to asymptomatic genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals.[^EberlyL-2021-35082480] Key documents include the 2015 AHA/ACC Eligibility and Disqualification Recommendations for Competitive Athletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities [^ZorziA-2021-33961139], the 2015 International Task Force Consensus Statement on Treatment of ARVC [^GasperettiA-2023-37935403], the 2019 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Evaluation, Risk Stratification, and Management of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy [^ZorziA-2021-33961139], the 2020 ESC Guidelines on sports cardiology and exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease [^ZorziA-2021-33961139], and the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies.[^MazzantiA-2025-39980788] These guidelines generally permit low-to-moderate intensity recreational activity based on individualized risk assessment.[^ShahSN-2024]
- **Dietary Management:** Specific dietary recommendations for ACM are generally absent in dedicated ACM guidelines. Management relies on adherence to general cardiovascular prevention and heart failure guidelines. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure [^AHA-heart-2022-ref120] and the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice [^Portailvascu-portai-2021-ref133] recommend heart-healthy dietary patterns (e.g., DASH, Mediterranean), sodium restriction for HF patients (typically 2-3 g/day, stricter if needed), and limiting unhealthy fats and added sugars.[^JuraschekS-2021-34045018] The 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease also emphasizes these dietary principles.[^ArnettD-2019-30879339]
- **Substance Use:** Guidelines universally recommend smoking cessation as part of cardiovascular risk reduction.[^Medscape-ND] General guidelines advise limiting alcohol consumption if consumed [^LichtensteinA-2021-34724806], although specific advice for the higher-risk ACM population often involves stricter limitation or avoidance.[^BHF-2025] Avoidance of illicit drugs is implicit in standard medical care and strongly advised given their cardiotoxicity.[^GiustinoG-2020-32517962] Guidelines on AF management (e.g., 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF Guideline [^JoglarJ-2024-38033089]) address risk factor modification including alcohol and potentially caffeine.
- **Weight Management:** Guidelines for cardiovascular prevention and heart failure management recommend weight control for overweight and obese individuals.[^LichtensteinA-2021-34724806] The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline acknowledges the obesity paradox but supports weight management strategies, particularly in HFpEF.[^Cleveland-Obesit-2024-ref186] The 2023 ESC Cardiomyopathy guidelines emphasize multidisciplinary care which would include addressing comorbidities like obesity.[^IvanivY-2023-Overview2023]
- **Psychosocial Support:** While not always explicitly detailed as lifestyle *modification*, guidelines increasingly recognize the importance of patient-centered care, shared decision-making, and addressing psychosocial factors.[^IvanivY-2023-Overview2023] HF guidelines often recommend referral to specialized HF teams, which may include psychosocial support.[^HeidenreichP-2022-35379504] Consensus statements on professionalism and ethics also highlight the importance of addressing patient well-being.[^PHO-ND]
Clinicians managing ACM patients should consult these primary guideline documents for detailed recommendations and evidence grading, recognizing that advice must be tailored to the individual patient's clinical status, genetic background, risk profile, and personal preferences.

## X. Conclusion
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy represents a significant clinical challenge due to its genetic heterogeneity, variable expressivity, and propensity for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and progressive heart failure. While management has traditionally focused on device therapy and antiarrhythmic drugs, there is compelling evidence that lifestyle factors play a crucial role in modulating the disease course and outcomes.

The most robust evidence pertains to physical activity, with international guidelines strongly recommending restriction from competitive and high-intensity endurance exercise for both diagnosed patients and asymptomatic gene carriers to reduce arrhythmia risk and potentially slow disease progression. Exercise intensity appears to be a more critical determinant of risk than duration, allowing for individualized prescriptions of low-to-moderate intensity recreational activity in lower-risk individuals under expert guidance.

While direct evidence in ACM populations is limited for other lifestyle factors, extrapolation from general cardiovascular and heart failure principles provides a strong rationale for comprehensive lifestyle management. Adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns, appropriate sodium restriction tailored to heart failure status, and maintenance of a healthy body weight are important for managing comorbidities and potentially mitigating inflammatory and hemodynamic factors relevant to ACM. Absolute avoidance of smoking and illicit stimulant drugs is essential due to their established cardiotoxicity and arrhythmogenicity. Prudent limitation or avoidance of alcohol is also advised. Addressing the significant psychosocial burden through stress management techniques and integrated psychological support is vital for improving quality of life and potentially reducing stress-related arrhythmia triggers.

Integrating these lifestyle modifications – particularly exercise restriction, but also encompassing diet, substance avoidance, weight control, and psychosocial well-being – into the standard care plan complements traditional medical and device therapies. This holistic approach aims to reduce arrhythmia burden, improve heart failure symptoms, enhance quality of life, and potentially alter the natural history of this inherited cardiomyopathy. Further research specifically targeting the impact of dietary interventions and psychosocial support programs in diverse ACM populations is warranted to refine future management strategies.
