# Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies - Genetics
- ACM is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance.
	- A pathogenic gene variant can be identified in about 60–70% of definite ARVC cases[^1].
- The majority of these mutations involve genes encoding cardiac **desmosomal proteins**, which are crucial for cell-cell adhesion at intercalated disks.
	- Key desmosomal genes include:
		- **PKP2** (plakophilin-2): The most common variant (≈20–45% of cases)[^3].
		- **DSP** (desmoplakin).
		- **DSG2** (desmoglein-2).
		- **DSC2** (desmocollin-2).
		- **JUP** (junction plakoglobin).
	- Collectively, desmosomal mutations account for over half of ARVC cases[^3].
	- Specific associations:
		- **PKP2** truncating variants are classically associated with RV-predominant disease[^1] [^3].
		- **DSP** mutations often lead to biventricular or left-dominant disease and have been linked to more severe heart failure and arrhythmic outcomes[^1] [^3].
	- Mutations in desmosomal genes impair cell adhesion, leading to:
		- Increased mechanical stress sensitivity in cardiomyocytes.
		- Myocardial cell death, scar formation, and ventricular electrical instability[^5].
	- A novel mutation in **DSP** has been identified as causing ACM due to defective desmosomal protein connections[^2] [^5].
	- Gene therapy targeting **PKP2** mutations has shown promise in preclinical studies, restoring plakophilin-2 levels and improving sodium conduction and contractility in human heart muscle cells[^8].

- Among non-desmosomal genes:
	- Recent expert consensus has confirmed causative roles for specific mutations in:
		- **TMEM43**, **PLN**, and **DES**[^2].
	- Other genes previously associated with ARVC-like phenotypes include:
		- **LMNA** (lamin A/C).
		- **SCN5A** (cardiac sodium channel)[^5] [^3].
	- These mutations can present with varying combinations of arrhythmia and ventricular dysfunction, sometimes overlapping with dilated cardiomyopathy.

## Recessive Forms
- Rare autosomal recessive variants of ACM include:
	- **Naxos disease**:
		- Caused by a homozygous JUP mutation (plakoglobin).
		- Presents in childhood with ARVC, woolly hair, and palmoplantar keratoderma[^3] [^6].
		- Restoration of truncated plakoglobin levels has been shown to normalize heart function in experimental models, suggesting therapeutic potential[^2].
	- **Carvajal syndrome**:
		- Caused by certain homozygous DSP mutations.
		- Causes left-dominant ACM with early onset and similar skin/hair features[^3] [^7].
- These syndromic forms often manifest in pediatric patients and tend to be particularly malignant.

## Summary
- The genetic substrate leads to:
	- Defective cell adhesion.
	- Heightened mechanical stress sensitivity in cardiomyocytes.
	- Myocardial cell death, scar/fat infiltration, and ventricular electrical instability[^1] [^5].
- Mutations such as those in PKP2 also disrupt calcium homeostasis within cardiomyocytes, contributing to arrhythmogenesis[^4].
- **Exercise and catecholamines** greatly influence disease progression:
	- Vigorous exercise accelerates myocyte loss and scar formation.
	- This explains why trained athletes with a mutation often develop earlier and more severe ARVC[^1] [^8].
	- Enhanced catecholaminergic stress during physical activity increases susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias through mechanisms such as calcium dysregulation mediated by ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)[^4] [^8].
	- Exercise-induced catecholamine surges can increase adrenaline levels by up to 20 times the basal concentration during intense activity[^3] [^6].

## Genetic Testing and Counseling
Genetic testing plays a pivotal role in managing arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, both for confirming the diagnosis and for family screening. Current guidelines (HRS 2019 and ESC 2023) **recommend genetic testing in all definite ARVC/ACM patients** and even in "borderline" cases if a pathogenic mutation is suspected[^7]. Key points:
- **Genetic test yield:** As noted, about two-thirds of patients with clinical ARVC have an identifiable mutation in one of the known ACM genes[^1]. The yield is highest in patients with family history or multiple diagnostic criteria. A targeted panel including desmosomal genes (PKP2, DSP, DSG2, DSC2, JUP) and other associated genes (TMEM43, PLN, DES, LMNA, etc.) is usually performed. **PKP2** truncating mutations are the single most common finding[^3]. If genetic testing is negative, it doesn't exclude the disease (it may be a yet undiscovered gene or polygenic cause in ≈30% cases).

- **Interpreting results:** A *pathogenic* or *likely pathogenic* variant in an ARVC-associated gene can serve as a major diagnostic criterion[^5]. However, results must be interpreted cautiously, as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are common. Desmosomal genes have known pathogenic hotspots, but some variants may be simply rare polymorphisms. Whenever possible, genetic findings should be correlated with clinical phenotype (for example, a DSP truncation in a patient with LV scarring is compelling).

- **Genotype-phenotype correlations:** Knowing the specific gene can inform management in some cases. For instance, **TMEM43 p.S358L** is associated with very high risk of SCD (often warranting early ICD placement) and a high penetrance in male carriers[^1]. **LMNA** mutation carriers may develop significant conduction disease and require pacing/ICD for bradyarrhythmias in addition to VT risk. **DSP** mutation carriers tend to have more left ventricular disease and more frequent heart failure – they should be monitored closely for LV dysfunction[^1]. **Compound heterozygotes** (more than one ACM mutation) often have an earlier onset and more severe course[^1].

- **Family screening:** Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is typically autosomal dominant, so first-degree relatives of an affected patient should undergo evaluation. If a pathogenic mutation is identified in the proband, **cascade genetic testing** of relatives is recommended (after appropriate counseling). Genotype-positive family members (even if phenotype-negative initially) should receive periodic cardiac evaluations, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood when disease often manifests[^1]. In genotype-positive carriers, lifestyle adjustments (like avoiding high-intensity sports) may be advised even if they have no overt disease, as this may delay or reduce disease expression[^10]. If genetic testing in the proband is negative or not done, first-degree relatives should still undergo clinical screening (ECG, echo ± CMR, Holter) at intervals, since familial ARVC could be present with an unidentified mutation.

- **Genetic counseling:** Given the complexities, involvement of a genetic counselor or specialized clinic is important. Patients must understand the implications of test results for themselves and their family (including the possibility of detecting incidental findings or uncertain variants). Counseling is also vital before athletic screening or family planning decisions. ARVC is sometimes detected in athletes or military recruits via ECG – if identified, those individuals and their families should be offered genetic work-up.

In summary, genetic testing confirms the hereditary nature of ACM in most cases and allows **predictive screening** of relatives. It can also help distinguish true ACM from phenocopies (e.g., if a DSP mutation is found, it favors ARVC vs. an acquired scar from myocarditis). The presence of a known mutation does **not** always mean the individual will develop clinical disease (reduced penetrance), so follow-up is needed. Discovering a mutation can cause anxiety, so continuous counseling and psychological support may be beneficial as part of comprehensive care.

### Genetic Basis of ARVC
From a genetic perspective, pathogenic variants in the plakophilin-2 gene (PKP2) are the most common cause of ARVC, found in approximately 50% of cases[^18]. These mutations are associated with the conventional ARVC phenotype and typically result in better clinical outcomes compared to other genetic variants. Patients with PKP2 mutations are generally younger at diagnosis, have higher left ventricular ejection fraction, and are less likely to present with symptoms of heart failure[^18].
